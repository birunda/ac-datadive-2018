 The Request was submitted by an international NGO, Afrique-Europe Interact, with local
 
 representation in Mali. The NGO complained about land grabbing by the project and its adverse
 
 effects on the people living in the villages of Sanamadougou and Sahou. The inhabitants of these villages, who refused to leave their agricultural lands at the beginning of the project, have allegedly been subjected to serious violations of their rights and have received threats to their physical security. In addition, a number of those affected by the project (i.e. PAPs), were not compensated while a few others received only symbolic compensation amounts for their lands and properties. The Director of the Compliance Review and Mediation Unit (CRMU) registered the Request on 12 May, 2016 pending verification of two issues: (a) if there was any land dispute case pending
 
 before any courts in Mali at the time of submission of the Request, and (b) if the NGO, being a
 
 foreign representative, had obtained representational authority to act on behalf of the people affected by the project.

 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 The project will expand M3‚Äôs existing processing facilities to produce: (i) semolina from durum
 
 wheat, millet and maize; (ii) long and short pasta, as well as couscous from wheat, millet and
 
 maize; and (iii) flour from kibbled millet and maize. M3 will also acquire a new flour mill for the
 
 production of bread-quality wheat flour or ‚Äúflour mill‚Äù. The production residue will be used to
 
 produce animal feed.
 
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 The M3 is located approximately 230 km from Bamako, in the Rural Commune of S√©bougou
 
 which is almost part of the city of S√©gou. It is located on a plot involving eight contiguous land
 
 titles (TF No. 1133-1140 ) with a total area of 7 ha 15 a 38 ca. The town is under the supervision
 
 of the Sous-Prefect of S√©gou. The project‚Äôs influence extends to the rural communes of S√©bougou
 
 and S√©gou and their surroundings. Seven production chains will be set up on the M3 Project site
 
 at S√©gou. The project is expected to promote local agricultural development and to strengthen the
 
 value chains by creating direct and indirect employment as well as business opportunities for local
 
 entrepreneurs. By producing import substitutes, the project is expected to have a positive impact
 
 on the trade balance, while the increased local production will enhance food security by creating
 
 jobs and wealth for the country. 
 
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 The project involves the installation of units for the production of couscous and pasta. These
 
 include silos for the storage of raw materials (hard wheat, soft wheat, maize, millet and sorghum),
 
 and three (03) mills for the production of meal and flour to be used to supply production lines.
 
 Other facilities associated with the project include; boilers (steam and hot water), air compressors
 
 (compressed air production), refrigerators (cooling water production), and electric transformers. 
 
 Under the project, silos will be acquired, allowing for an increase in M3 storage capacity to 20,000
 
 tons for durum wheat, 5,000 tons for maize, and 5,000 tons for millet.

 The project is a ‚Ç¨200 million loan to Public Enterprise Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS),
 
 guaranteed by the Republic of Serbia, and subject to the Bank‚Äôs policy requirements for
 
 public sector projects. 
 
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 The loan proceeds will be used to restructure EPS‚Äôs balance sheet, replacing short and
 
 medium term financial debt entered into on an emergency basis to alleviate a critical cash
 
 situation created by the unprecedented and catastrophic floods in Serbia in 2014. EBRD‚Äôs
 
 operation provides long term debt with terms better matched to the underlying assets and
 
 EPS‚Äôs operations. The refinancing will free up resources to allow the EPS to focus on the
 
 implementation of its long term capital expenditure program, which involves substantial
 
 modernisation of Serbia‚Äôs power sector infrastructure.
 
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 This Project will also allow EBRD to continue its engagement with EPS on environmental and
 
 social issues.
 
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 In this new Project, following the EBRD‚Äôs due diligence carried out with the assistance of TCfunded
 
 independent consultant, a new, updated Company-wide ESAP was agreed that
 
 provides a comprehensive response to environmental and social issues associated with
 
 EPS‚Äôs operations. EPS is committed to enhancing its environmental and social management
 
 systems for the restructured Company in line with good international practice and will be
 
 revising its corporate environmental and social strategy accordingly. The strategy will be
 
 based on an outline prepared by the consultants, which includes a new Resettlement
 
 Framework. The ESAP also reinforces the commitment to implement the action plans from
 
 the company-wide EHS audits. These further actions address a number of the
 
 recommendations of the PCM Compliance Review on the Kolubara Environmental
 
 Improvement Project. A post-signing TC provided a consultant to survey EPS for corporate
 
 governance gaps and to provide an action plan to remedy them.

We have assisted communities to raise complaints about large-scale mining ventures affecting their water resources and endangering their livelihoods, specifically the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine (‚ÄúOT Project‚Äù) and the Ukhaa Khudag coal mine.</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>The OT Project has faced fierce community resistance in Mongolia for years. One of the biggest concerns is the amount of water, a scarce and valuable resource in the South Gobi desert, that the Project will require. Traditional nomadic herders, who have lived in the region for centuries, have already experienced problems with wells going dry. Additionally, the infrastructure and construction related to the Project is degrading and fragmenting herders‚Äô traditional pastures, forcing some of them to abandon their herding lifestyles. Several herders have already experienced devastating herd loss and other impacts after being forced to resettle because of the OT Project. Furthermore, herders complaint that the company forced them to sign unfair contracts in violation of their rights. They have found the company largely unresponsive to their concerns.</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>The $13.2 billion OT Project, operated by Rio Tinto, is the largest foreign investment in Mongolia. Despite the OT Project‚Äôs numerous problems, the project is supported by the World Bank Group‚Äôs International Finance Corporation (‚ÄúIFC‚Äù) and Multilateral Insurance Guarantee Agency (‚ÄúMIGA‚Äù), as well as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (‚ÄúEBRD‚Äù). The Netherlands Development Finance Company (‚ÄúFMO‚Äù), U.S. Export-Import Bank, Export Development Canada and the Australian Export Finance and Insurance Corporation have also committed financing for the project.</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>Accountability Counsel has supported two complaints to the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, the accountability office for the IFC and MIGA, raising concerns about the OT Project‚Äôs impacts on local water resources and about the adequacy of resettlement and compensation packages. The CAO has convened a dialogue process to assist the herders to reach an agreement with the project company on these issues. The dialogue process is ongoing and has resulted in the establishment of a Tripartite Council, with herder representatives meeting with local government and company representatives on a monthly bases to work towards resolution of the CAO complaints and future community grievances related to the project.</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>The Ukhaa Khudag coal mine is located on a section of the world‚Äôs largest untapped coking coal and thermal coal deposits, the Tavan Tolgoi. The mine is operated by a Mongolian company, Energy Resources LLC, and is commonly referred to as the ‚ÄúEnergy Resources Mine.‚Äù Most of its coal product is shipped over land to the Chinese boarder, which has led to the gradual development of a sprawling web of mining roads, ranging from paved roads to informal dirt roads intersecting each other and multiplying by the day. These roads and other project infrastructure have led to severe fragmentation of herders‚Äô pastures, excessive dust and unsafe road conditions which in turn have resulted in fatal traffic accidents and other concerns over herder and animal health. The Energy Resources Mine has received financing from the EBRD.</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>In 2013, local herders filed a series of complaints to the EBRD‚Äôs Project Complaint Mechanism (‚ÄúPCM‚Äù) raising concerns about pasture fragmentation, dust, and other impacts from the growing network of roads and infrastructure associated with both the OT Project and Energy Resources Mine. Accountability Counsel has supported herders throughout the complaint process and a compliance audit is currently underway to investigate allegations of EBRD policy violations.</p>",FALSE,FALSE,7/2/13,7/2/13,8/2/13,closed_with_outcome,,8/2/13,12/22/14,closed_with_outcome,,,,not_undertaken,Not offered by mechanism,12/22/14,,in_progress,,,,,,

 The project will support the urban development of three medium-sized cities in the southwestern part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) Fangchenggang City, Chongzuo City, and Baise City. All the project cities are surrounded by counties with widespread poverty. The project will have six investment components in the project cities and one capacity development component. The investment components in each project city will be part of an overall city development program guided by a well prepared city development master plan. The capacity development component is designed to complement the infrastructure development to be funded under the project. It is part of the national poverty reduction strategy to promote inclusive growth in the less-developed western PRC. The project has adopted a holistic approach to building urban roads and underground municipal infrastructure in a coherent and integrated manner. Construction of urban infrastructure is supported with capacity development and environmental improvement components, including activities to strengthen climate change resilience of coastal and inland urban areas. The complaint pertains to the Fangchenggang component of this project. Based on immediately available project documents, this component will include the construction of a (i) 17.285 km road network; (ii) ii) Main and secondary sewer and drainage system in the Gongche Industrial Park; and (iii) Anfujiang Bridge with total length of 240 m. Some construction works in Fangchenggang were delayed due to relocation issues but a special review mission by ADB (PRCM) from 28 November to 2 December 2016 settled the major land acquisition and resettlement issue thereby resulting to the resumption of works.

 On 18 December 2014, the Bank approved the Road and Transport Facilitation Programme
 
 within the Mano River Union (MRU). The Governments of C√¥te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and
 
 Sierra Leone submitted a request to the Bank for financing to develop and asphalt the Danan√©-
 
 Lola road (87.35 km), the Blol√©quin-Toul√©pleu-Liberian border road (65 km), the Tablo-Prollo
 
 road (28 km), the Karloken-Fish Town (80 km) and the Harper-Cavally junction (16 km).
 
 These constitute 276.35 km of currently dirt roads, barely 6 m wide, impassable in all seasons,
 
 with makeshift wooden crossing structures, for the most part. Regional isolation, the high
 
 number of roadside checks and unsuitable border crossings are factors of fragility which
 
 compound the successive crises that have affected the region over the last 20 years. However,
 
 traffic is set to grow on these roads given the economic potential of the area and the efforts to
 
 lift these countries out of the recurrent crises that have long characterised them. In order to
 
 cope with current and future traffic, it is imperative to improve the road service level, enhance
 
 their capacity to withstand traffic in all seasons and reduce border controls; this will require
 
 asphalting and developing the roads and establishing border crossings for joint controls. 
 
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 The overall objective of the programme is to boost post-conflict economic recovery of the
 
 MRU area by improving road infrastructure and promoting intra-community trade.
 
 Specifically, the programme seeks to: (i) improve transport conditions on the roads concerned
 
 in order to reduce transport costs, (ii) facilitate the free movement of persons and goods
 
 between the three countries, namely C√¥te d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia and improve the living
 
 conditions of programme area communities.
 
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 The Guinean component of the programme includes, among other things, paving of the LolaIvorian
 
 border road (39.75 km).

We have assisted communities to raise complaints about large-scale mining ventures affecting their water resources and endangering their livelihoods, specifically the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine (‚ÄúOT Project‚Äù) and the Ukhaa Khudag coal mine.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The OT Project has faced fierce community resistance in Mongolia for years. One of the biggest concerns is the amount of water, a scarce and valuable resource in the South Gobi desert, that the Project will require. Traditional nomadic herders, who have lived in the region for centuries, have already experienced problems with wells going dry. Additionally, the infrastructure and construction related to the Project is degrading and fragmenting herders‚Äô traditional pastures, forcing some of them to abandon their herding lifestyles. Several herders have already experienced devastating herd loss and other impacts after being forced to resettle because of the OT Project. Furthermore, herders complaint that the company forced them to sign unfair contracts in violation of their rights. They have found the company largely unresponsive to their concerns.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The $13.2 billion OT Project, operated by Rio Tinto, is the largest foreign investment in Mongolia. Despite the OT Project‚Äôs numerous problems, the project is supported by the World Bank Group‚Äôs International Finance Corporation (‚ÄúIFC‚Äù) and Multilateral Insurance Guarantee Agency (‚ÄúMIGA‚Äù), as well as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (‚ÄúEBRD‚Äù). The Netherlands Development Finance Company (‚ÄúFMO‚Äù), U.S. Export-Import Bank, Export Development Canada and the Australian Export Finance and Insurance Corporation have also committed financing for the project.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Accountability Counsel has supported two complaints to the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, the accountability office for the IFC and MIGA, raising concerns about the OT Project‚Äôs impacts on local water resources and about the adequacy of resettlement and compensation packages. The CAO has convened a dialogue process to assist the herders to reach an agreement with the project company on these issues. The dialogue process is ongoing and has resulted in the establishment of a Tripartite Council, with herder representatives meeting with local government and company representatives on a monthly bases to work towards resolution of the CAO complaints and future community grievances related to the project.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The Ukhaa Khudag coal mine is located on a section of the world‚Äôs largest untapped coking coal and thermal coal deposits, the Tavan Tolgoi. The mine is operated by a Mongolian company, Energy Resources LLC, and is commonly referred to as the ‚ÄúEnergy Resources Mine.‚Äù Most of its coal product is shipped over land to the Chinese boarder, which has led to the gradual development of a sprawling web of mining roads, ranging from paved roads to informal dirt roads intersecting each other and multiplying by the day. These roads and other project infrastructure have led to severe fragmentation of herders‚Äô pastures, excessive dust and unsafe road conditions which in turn have resulted in fatal traffic accidents and other concerns over herder and animal health. The Energy Resources Mine has received financing from the EBRD.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>In 2013, local herders filed a series of complaints to the EBRD‚Äôs Project Complaint Mechanism (‚ÄúPCM‚Äù) raising concerns about pasture fragmentation, dust, and other impacts from the growing network of roads and infrastructure associated with both the OT Project and Energy Resources Mine. Accountability Counsel has supported herders throughout the complaint process and a compliance audit is currently underway to investigate allegations of EBRD policy violations.</p>",FALSE,FALSE,2/11/13,,,not_undertaken,,2/11/13,2/1/13,closed_with_outcome,,7/1/13,,closed_with_outcome,,,,not_undertaken,,,,not_undertaken,,6/30/14

 The loans are part of Tranche 2 of a multi-tranche financing facility whose target outcome is the achievement of a cleaner electricity mix with more efficient and effective generation and transmission system in Rajasthan. Funding under Tranche 2 is comprised of two loans with $238 million (i.e., Loan 3482) from ADB‚Äôs Ordinary Capital Resources and $110 million (i.e., Loan 8312) from the Clean Technology Fund (an external fund administered by ADB). Tranche 2 was approved by ADB on 5 December 2016. The loans have not been signed yet and are not yet effective. Tranche 2 will finance investments in (i) construction of 210 km of 765kV transmission line, 264 km of 400kV transmission line, 240 km of 220kV double circuit transmission line, 132 km of 132kV transmission line, and Optical Ground Wires (OPGW) to connect existing substations; and (ii) construction of eight substations, augmentation of transformers at two substations, and bay extensions at five substations. CO2 reduction of 8,578,704 tons per annum is an indirect benefit of this project, which will be achieved by transmitting renewable energy to be generated from Western Rajasthan.

 The Requesters, principally dedicated toward agricultural activities for their food security and economic sustenance, were land owners in the area selected for the Project. The Requesters allege that their displacement from the land had been carried out with minimal days‚Äô notice, without consultation with the communities, and without information having been provided in this regard.
 
 
 
 In addition, the Requesters signal that the compensation offered would have been received several years later, and that it would have been inadequate to ensure the quality of life of the requesting families. This, in turn, would have led to poorer living conditions, in comparison to the conditions existent prior to the displacement, due to the resulting situation that would not allow the Requesters to cover their cost of living. Furthermore, the Request alleges that some families have not, to date, received compensation, after six years of the displacement having taken place.
 
 
 
 The Request also raises the issue of harm to the requesting families due to the lack of information regarding the environmental impacts on the Caracol Bay zone and the Troud-du North River, as a result of the construction and operation of the Park; such is also the case with respect to the social impacts experienced by the surrounding communities due to the introduction of the Project. Finally, the Request also presents information about the possible violations of labor codes in relation to the personnel that currently works in the Park.",FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The Sendou Coal-Fired Power Plant Project was approved on 25 November 2009 by the Board
 
 of Directors as a senior loan of 55 million euros in favor of Compagnie d‚ÄôElectrictie du Senegal
 
 (CES) to develop and maintain a 125 MW coal-fired power plant located 35 km from Dakar in
 
 Sendou, Senegal. In addition, the AfDB approved a supplementary loan of Euros 5 million and
 
 had disbursed 55 million euros as of 8 March 2017. The total cost of the Project is Euro 206
 
 million. The Bank co-finances this amount with the Banque Ouest Africaine de D√©veloppement
 
 (BOAD) and the Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V.
 
 (FMO). The project is being developed on a ‚Äúbuild, own, and operate‚Äù basis and targets to supply
 
 up to 40% of Senegal‚Äôs electricity, which currently derives 80% of its electricity from diesel-fueled power generation. The Government of Senegal (GOS) has outlined a strategy for diversifying and
 
 increasing domestic power generation capacity with a combination of conventional thermal base
 
 load and renewable energy. It is the first coal-fired plant in Senegal. The coal will be imported via
 
 sea and unloaded at Dakar harbor from where it will be transported by trucks to the coal storage
 
 site on the plant. The project aims at producing at least 925 GWh of electricity a year. The power
 
 will be delivered to the national interconnected grid system of SENELEC, Senegal‚Äôs public
 
 electricity utility company. The project includes the development, design, procurement,
 
 construction, operation and maintenance of a 125 MW coal-fired power plant on a 22 hectare-site.
 
 Power production can be expanded to 250 MW through a second phase project, for which project
 
 preparation have not yet started. The project will also build a 1.6 km 225 kV transmission line and
 
 associated switchyard to connect the plant to SENELEC. 
 
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 The project is located about 600 meters away from the Atlantic Ocean and near two
 
 communities, the town of Bargny located at 2 km north-west and a fishing village, Minam, with
 
 600 inhabitants to the south. The project is located 500 meters from dwellings, a school, a
 
 watercourse, a lake and a water collection point and areas designated for residential developments.
 
 A 500 meter buffer zone around the plant is required by Senegalese law. Active on the grounds of
 
 the power plant is a substantial group of women who regularly ‚Äì since many generations ‚Äì dry fish
 
 on the ground which they receive from fishermen at the Bargny harbor. These activities require
 
 space as fish is laid out on the ground for drying. Between 1000 and 4000 women pursue this
 
 activity for about 9 months during the year. Dried fish is then sold to male workers who package
 
 the dried fish and transport it to markets in Dakar and to the harbor for export.

 The Project Company is Compagnie d‚ÄôElectricite du Snegal SA (CES), whose original sponsor
 
 was Nykomb Synergetics of Sweden. Late in 2012, AFG, an investment bank of Morocco joined
 
 as equity partner. In October 2015, Quantum Power acquired the equity interest of AFG and
 
 became joint equity sponsor with Nykomb. The construction of the power plant has been
 
 contracted out to two Indian companies: Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHIEL) and Promac
 
 Engineering Industries Ltd (Promac). The new Project Sponsor, Quantum Power, took necessary
 
 measures to relaunch the construction of the power plant, and to secure additional equity needed
 
 to complete the Project. Construction resumed in January 2016 and the Project is now scheduled
 
 to begin commercial operation by end of 2017.

 The Project is part of an overall investment program valued at $1.1 billion to be
 
 implemented from 2010-2020 which aims to improve the reach, quality, and continuity of urban
 
 transport in Georgia. To partially fund it, a multi-tranche financing facility (MFF) with a maximum
 
 financing amount of $300 million was approved by ADB in July 2010. Said MFF which is to be
 
 implemented from 2010 to 2018, is for the (i) extension, rehabilitation, and improvement of
 
 urban transport infrastructure in Anaklia, Batumi, Kutaisi, Poti, Rustavi, and Tbilisi; (ii) increased
 
 institutional effectiveness, including the reorganization and reforms at the Tbilisi municipality,
 
 other municipalities and urban transport service providers; and (iii) establishment of program
 
 management team with a capability and funds to handle project preparation, technical design,
 
 contract bidding, evaluation and award, contract supervision, progress monitoring and
 
 reporting. Investments funded under the MFF will improve the transport system and
 
 infrastructure in urban areas. They include two subprojects: (i) section 2 (km 4.0-10.8) of the
 
 international standard Tbilisi-Rustavi Urban Road Link; and (ii) phase 2 of Anaklia Coastal
 
 Improvement. 
 
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
 
 The Project is funded under Tranche 3 of the MFF, which was approved on 25
 
 November 2013. The total project cost is $118.2 million and ADB funds $73 million under this
 
 tranche. The borrower is the Government of Georgia and the Municipal Development Fund
 
 (MDF) of Georgia is the executing agency. The Project, which is implemented from ADB
 
 Headquarters by the Urban Development and Water Division of the Central and West Asia
 
 Department, is categorized as B for environmental impacts; A for involuntary resettlement
 
 impacts; C for indigenous peoples‚Äô impacts. Construction work under the project has not yet,
 
 started. Procurement of the civil works contract is ongoing. Commencement of the works is not
 
 anticipated before August 2016. A draft initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Project
 
 was completed and posted on the ADB website in September 2013. This initial IEE was revised
 
 as vibration and noise impacts needed to be studied. A revised IEE was posted on the ADB
 
 website in December 2015. The construction of Section 2 of 6.8 km will involve acquisition of
 
 312 land plots with 29.5 hectares of land areas, demolition of 692 structures (82 residential
 
 structures, 90 industrial and commercial structures, and 520 minor structures). A total of 282
 
 households and 33 businesses will be affected. Per ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS),3
 
  a
 
 land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) was prepared prior to the approval of the
 
 MFF. Subsequently the land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) was prepared. It is
 
 presently under implementation.

 The complaint refers to subproject 1: Tbilisi-Rustavi Urban Road Link (section 2) of the
 
 Project which involves the modernization of an existing and construction of a new road from
 
 Phonichala to Rustavi. When finished, the total road length for this Project will be 6.8 km, of
 
 which 3.8 km is new road construction along the Mktvari river. Once completed, it is expected
 
 that the road will be of international standard, Category I highway, with 4 to 6 lanes and with a
 
 general design that can accommodate vehicles with speed of 120km/h. In some areas, a
 
 reduction of speed is anticipated to mitigate noise impacts.
