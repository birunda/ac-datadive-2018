# accountability-counsel-11th-hour

Accountability Counsel is a nonprofit organization committed to helping communities battle the harmful effects of international development projects in their area. 

Accountability Counsel keeps track of the progress of each complaint filed in order to keep track of the outcomes; Did it lead to a compliance investigation? Was there a resolution for a change? Or was the complaint deemed ineligible, and a new plan of action needs to be made? 

The status of complaints is freely available to the public across all the different IAMs (Independent Accountability Mechanisms) for every major bank/financial institute. However, each of these has its own website without an API for easy data access. Gathering data and monitoring complaint statuses across IAMs has been separate and painfully manual. Accountability counsel has collected this data over the past 15+ years by manually looking up the information for individual complaints on each website and recording it on Excel. They have begun to automate this lookup process, clean up this data so that it is more consistent across sources, and are hoping to leverage this data set to support a variety of analytics (including their visualization tool https://www.accountabilityconsole.com/). 

One such example of analytics is the study of complaint ineligibility i.e. identifying any commonalities across complaints that are deemed ineligible and/or factors driving ineligibility. In the data itself, there are roughly 60 unique reasons listed why complaints have been found ineligible according to the IAMs. With a deeper and quantitatively backed understanding of why complaints are found ineligible, Accountability Counsel plans to write a white paper for the IAMs, inform improvements for their own Policy team, and display the relevant data back to end users on Accountability Console. 

In this project, DataKind will focus on and explore Accountability Console’s ‘complaint’ data, teasing out interesting ways to examine ‘ineligibility’, its correlation with other variables, and the potential corresponding visualizations and/or aggregations that could ultimately be incorporated into their Accountability Console. 

This initial examination of the complaint data will likely uncover gaps and inconsistencies in the underlying data, which is common for manually gathered data. In order to address those, DataKind can give recommendations based on the results of any data audit done during the project. These recommendations can also be used upstream to inform how the data is being captured and the format it is stored. 

Over time, this initial exploration could lead to model creation for predicting the likelihood of complaint ineligibility, assuming that the data could support that type of model.
